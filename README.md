# Tailwind CSS Project-Based Course

This is a fun, **project-based course** designed to help you learn how to create awesome layouts using the **Tailwind CSS framework**.  
Instead of relying on component-based frameworks like Bootstrap, this course helps you get comfortable with **utility-first classes** and the Tailwind workflow.

## 📚 Course Outline

### ✔️ The Sandbox
Before jumping into projects, we’ll start with a coding sandbox.  
Each new video/file will focus on a specific aspect of Tailwind, allowing you to explore all the key utility classes in a structured order.

Topics include:
- Colors
- Typography
- Spacing
- Flexbox
- Grid
- And much more...

This foundation ensures you’re confident with Tailwind’s utilities before moving on to real projects.

### ✔️ Mini-Projects
Once you’re comfortable in the sandbox, you’ll apply what you’ve learned to small, focused projects.  
Each mini-project is designed to take **10–20 minutes**.

Mini-projects include:
- 📧 Email Subscribe Card  
- 💰 Pricing Grids  
- 📦 Product Modal  
- 🖼️ Image Gallery  
- 🔐 Login Modal
